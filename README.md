# Assignment 6

__Run__

By running "python3 search.py" will run a new set of simulations and show the snake that has the furthest negative x-coordinate.

__Link Creation__

I created attributes of solution.py that detailed the number of links, it was a random range from 5-13 in my case and I used for loops that
ran through the number of links and assigned motor neurons to each, and sensor neurons for random links. Sensor links are green and non-sensor
neurons are blue.

__Credits__

Much inspiration drawn from Ludobots on Reddit, used Pyrosim, Pybullet, Numpy to create this project.
