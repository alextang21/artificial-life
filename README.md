**PRONKING ROBOT**
This robot was made initially using Ludobots and took inspiration from their final project section for Pronking. The tutorial/reddit page is listed here: https://www.reddit.com/r/ludobots/

**FITNESS**
The fitness was based on minimizing the amount of time that all four lower legs were in contact with the ground.

**EVOLUTION**
The aspects of the robot that were taken into consideration when finding evolutions and best fitness was the power of the legs as well as the angles they were moving.
